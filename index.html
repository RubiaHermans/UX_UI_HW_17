        <li class="inline-block">From a young age, I honed my skills in design tools such as CorelDRAW and Photoshop, guided by the expertise of my father, a seasoned graphic designer. During my formative years, I immersed myself in the world of design, working alongside him at the local cybercafé after school. My educational journey led me to pursue studies in fashion design at a technical high school, followed by a deeper dive into human resources and ultimately graduating as an interior designer. Design has always been the cornerstone of my existence, shaping both my personal and professional identity.

As a UX/UI Designer from Brazil, currently based in the vibrant Bay Area, I thrive on curating immersive experiences and materializing visions through the art of design. Drawing from my background in interior design and illustration, I possess an innate ability to infuse every project with meticulous attention to detail and a narrative-driven approach.

I've always been interested in making spaces look nice and telling stories with pictures. I believe design is about more than just making things pretty—it's about making people feel something and helping them connect with each other.

My educational path reflects my unwavering commitment to design excellence. From immersing myself in the intricacies of fashion design at a technical high school to delving into the complexities of human resources, each step has shaped my multifaceted approach to design. Ultimately, I emerged as an interior designer, equipped with a holistic understanding of space, aesthetics, and human behavior.Outside of work, I enjoy taking care of my indoor garden with 50 plants, painting with acrylic paint and spending time with my cat. Nature inspires me, and I try to bring a sense of peace and energy into everything I do, both personally and professionally.
